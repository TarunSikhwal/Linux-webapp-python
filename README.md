# Linux-webapp-python

🛑 So hello guys 

✔So I created this very simple webapp which is a server side language python based including the following concepts & some extra things -->
👀
1) Core API concept
2) Core CGI concept( i used cgi-bin folder for apache http server)
3) Http protocol
4) Python script --> including she bang lines & header lines for web browser
5) Difference between webpage(static) & webapp(program runs & output shown to u)
6) I used subprocess module instead of os module due to some of it's limitations
7) Used the cgi field storage concept for retreiving variables from clients👨‍💻

⭕The main aim of the webapp⭕
✅Here I connected my linux os server & wrote the python script so that anyone from public world can come & see the webapp and can enter which command they would like to run in linux & the output will be shown in the webapp page without logging in into the os or server😍

✨✨
